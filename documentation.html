					    <p>JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2024, 98.9% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
					    </p>
					    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.[11] It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).
                        </p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.</li>
						<li>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</li>
					  </ul>

					  <h2>JavaScript-and-java</h2>
					  <article>
					   <p>At its core, Java was designed to be a language that could run on any device and operating system. Java is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) language that follows the JavaBeans development model. This means developers can take advantage of classes, objects, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism for easier code writing.
                       </p>
					   <p>Java also has Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that allows Java code to be run on any platform. Java also has a large library of pre-made classes and functions for users to call upon. Java is mainly used in Android development, server applications, software development, and web applications.
                       </p>
					   <p>JavaScript — initially called Mocha and then LiveScript — has changed its name a couple of times since its creation. It was created by Brenden Eich in 1995 for Netscape Navigator, Netscape’s flagship web browser. The name JavaScript, coined as a marketing ploy, was meant to piggyback on the popularity of Java and Netscape's support of Java applets in its browser.

					  <h2>Hello-world</h2>
					  <article>
					   To get started with writing JavaScript,open the Scratchpad and write
					   your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:
					   <code>
					   function greetMe(yourName){alert("Hello " + yourName);}
					   greetMe("World");
					   </code>
					   Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unflod in your
					   browser!

					   <p>Frameworks – JavaScript has one of the powerful frameworks. The framework is a set of collections of codes that are used by programmers while creating an application. Powerful frameworks add different features and functional elements for the websites and applications. 
                       </p>
					   <p>Browser-Control – JavaScript is primarily used for client-side development and runs on the browser. It gives more control to the browser ensuring lesser load on the server, increasing efficiency of writing, implementing the code, using it for validation and user inputs. 
                       </p>
					   <p>Speed – JavaScript ensures a rapid development process due to its execution directly on the browser. It minimises support from the server for even the basic and simple calculations that increase efficiency and save time. 
                       </p>
